    "<br />Get useful features such as:<br />   - Listing price<br />   - Sales price<br />   - Days on market<br />   - Num beds<br />   - Num baths<br />   - Age<br />   - Tax<br />   - School district<br />   - Attractions - school, worship, waterfront, etc.<br />   - Zillow valuation score<br />You might be predicting/improving the Zillow valuation score as the y-variable, or predicting if it is going to sell using days on market or sale completion as the y-variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Pandas** is a Python package built upon Nympy to create DataFrames. This is good for Data Science to allow users to organize, display, modify, inspect data and much more. \n",
    "> **More Information**: Official Website: https://pandas.pydata.org\n",
    "\n",
    "**BeautifulSoup** is another Python package for web scrapping. This allows us to extract any information from websites and manipulate it whatever we want to do.\n",

    "> **More Information**: Official Website: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selenium** drives a browser natively, as a user would, either locally or on a remote machine using the Selenium server, marks a leap forward in terms of browser automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **More Information**: Selenium requires a web driver to launch. For this program, we chose the Chrome web driver. Use the link (https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) to download the appropriate driver.<br /><br />Once the driver is downloaded, click the executable to run it. You must have the Chrome browser also installed on the device. Check the Chrome browser version and download the propriate web driver version. For example, for Chrome version 106.0.5249.103, you would choose the Chrome 106 web driver. In our code, we avoid this hassle by using webdriver_manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "**webdriver_manager** is a python package that simplifies the installation and management of binary drivers for different browsers\n",
